#### Why did I even name this maqUI?

<p>Well, in December 2020, I went on a trek to Western Ghats. The trek was 7 hours long ad all we had was oranges and some berry that looked exactly like maqui to eat.
That trek was part of my first Solo Travel and I made great memories, so as a tribute I've named it after a fruit that looked similar.
